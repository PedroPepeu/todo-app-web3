## üéØ Priority Order
1. **High Priority**: Fix failing tests, deploy smart contract, set up environment variables, test integration
2. **Medium Priority**: Testing, documentation, deployment
3. **Low Priority**: Additional features, optimization

## üìù Notes
- ‚úÖ Frontend is complete with authentication, todo management, and tests
- ‚úÖ Smart contract is tested and ready for deployment
- ‚úÖ Users can now create accounts with automatic wallet generation
- ‚úÖ Both traditional login and MetaMask integration available (MetaMask currently disabled)
- üîÑ Next: Fix failing tests, deploy contract, and connect frontend to blockchain

   npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/TodoList.js --network sepolia
   ```

3. **Set up Environment Variables**:
   - Create `.env` in root with RPC URL and private key
   - Create `.env` in frontend with WalletConnect ID and contract address

4. **Test the Application**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
